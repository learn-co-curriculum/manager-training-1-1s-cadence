# manager-training-1-1s-cadence

While once a week may be the suggested timing, but think about the maturity of the report and the task maturity of the thing they are working on. If they are doing longer research-based work, maybe less frequent 1:1s work. Otherwise, more frequent opportunities to reflect are usually valuable. 

Whatever your cadence may be, always think dependability. We are creatures of habit. This should be a part of the flow of the week. If you find that you are rescheduling 1:1s regularly, understand that this sends a very strong message whether you intend to send it or not. Canceling a 1:1 sends another message, and one you definitely want to avoid.
